The goal was to classify a given test dataaset of 3809 images into the 5 possible categories : Human Faces, Cars, Flowers, Buildings and Shoes using any opensource/designed machine learning algorithm and libraries/tools.

Training and Validation datasets were rolled out a few days before the actual competition.

Within 24 hours of release of the testing data, the teams had to submit the final code, documentation and obviously the resulting labels of their classification algorithm.

Read the documentation and the 'execute.m' script for description of the algorithm and code we have used.
